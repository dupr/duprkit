# FAQ

* I'm a Ubuntu (or LinuxMint, Kali, Deepin) user, can I use this?

Of course. Theoretically the whole Debian family can use this.

* Where is the resulting `.deb` files?

DUPR, or .durpkg are not designed to deliver `.deb` files. It's recommended
to build everything locally after careful review.

* Why is this project hosted on GitHub instead of Debian's Salsa server?

Only 1000~2000 people on this earth have salsa account. More than a million
people have their Github accounts. Hosting this project on github makes access
and contributing easy.

* I dislike the HFT format...

HFT is not mandatory. Please carefully read the documentations and templates.

* Where can I submit my `.durpkg` file?

Submit a PR to https://github.com/dupr/DefaultCollection . Or setup your own collection.

* Why is it "D\*\*ian" ?

D**ian may be pronounced as "Dasteriskian", i.e. "D-asterisk-ian". ([propose a better name here](https://github.com/dupr/duprkit/issues/2))

This implementation allows non-DFSG stuff or dirty stuff.
Some people think some derived works may taint the name of Debian.
