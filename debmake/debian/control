Description: helper script to make the Debian source package
 This package helps you to convert an upstream source package (or VCS contents)
 into the Debian package by adding files required for the Debian source
 package.  The generated debian/rules file uses the new dh command syntax from
 the debhelper (>=11~) package.
 .
 The debmake command invoked in the upstream source tree without any option can
 generate files which is good enough to create a single arch=any Debian binary
 package for local use without touching them.  The generated files should be
 edited to make it conform to the Debian policy if the package is to be
 uploaded to the Debian archive.  By adding few options, this command can
 generate template files for the arbitrary combination of the multi-binary and
 multi-arch package, etc.  This includes making of the rules file for the -dbg
 package and the control file for the multiarch library package.
 .
 This debmake command also scans copyright and license texts in the source
 files to help crafting the proper DEP-5 compatible debian/copyright file.
 It does more than what licensecheck(1) offers.
