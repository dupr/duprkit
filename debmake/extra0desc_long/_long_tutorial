 .
 The synopsis description at the top should be about 60 characters and
 written as a phrase.  No extra capital letters or a final period.  No
 articles â€” "a", "an", or "the".
 .
 The package description for general-purpose applications should be
 written for a less technical user.  This means that we should avoid
 jargon.  GNOME or KDE is fine but GTK+ is probably not. 
 .
 Use the canonical forms of words:
  * Use X Window System, X11, or X; not X Windows, X-Windows, or X Window.
  * Use GTK+, not GTK or gtk. 
  * Use GNOME, not Gnome.
  * Use PostScript, not Postscript or postscript.
