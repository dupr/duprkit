 This license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 * d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work.
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.
 .
 You may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 Preamble
 .
 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
 community in the case of network server software.
 .
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
 away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General
 Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
 versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
 General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
 distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
 receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
 software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
 these things.
 .
 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
 steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
 software.
 .
 A secondary benefit of defending all users&apos; freedom is that improvements
 made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use,
 become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free
 software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in
 the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come
 about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code
 to the public.
 .
 The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
 in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It
 requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
 modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
 use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
 access to the source code of the modified version.
 .
 An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
 Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,
 not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
 Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 0. Definitions.
 .
 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
 such as semiconductor masks.
 .
 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
 Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
 individuals or organizations.
 .
 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
 fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
 The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
 "based on" the earlier work.
 .
 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
 Program.
 .
 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
 would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
 copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
 Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
 making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
 make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
 network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
 extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
 displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
 no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
 that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
 of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
 such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
 1. Source Code.
 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
 .
 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
 defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
 for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
 working in that language.
 .
 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
 work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
 Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
 to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
 Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
 form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
 which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
 object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source
 code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
 code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work&apos;s System Libraries, or
 general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
 unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
 For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
 associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
 libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
 designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
 between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
 automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
 .
 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
 .
 2. Basic Permissions.
 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
 the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
 License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
 Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
 if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
 acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
 copyright law.
 .
 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
 conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
 covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
 exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
 provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
 material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
 the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
 direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
 conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
 unnecessary.
 .
 3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
 under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
 copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
 restricting circumvention of such measures.
 .
 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
 effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
 work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
 work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s users, your or third
 parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
 .
 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you receive
 it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
 each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
 this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
 to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
 all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
 offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
 from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
 provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
 giving a relevant date.
 .
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
 License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
 requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
 .
 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
 who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
 with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
 all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
 permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
 such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
 Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
 display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
 .
 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
 which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
 combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
 storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and
 its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
 compilation&apos;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of
 a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
 other parts of the aggregate.
 .
 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
 under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
 .
 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on
 a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
 least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
 support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
 either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
 product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
 customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
 reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
 access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer
 to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
 occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
 such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
 .
 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or
 for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the
 same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require
 recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the
 place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may
 be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
 equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
 the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of
 what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that
 it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform
 other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are
 being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
 .
 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
 Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
 object code work.
 .
 A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
 personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
 purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
 In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
 resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
 particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
 class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
 in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
 the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product
 has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
 represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
 "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
 authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
 modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
 version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
 that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
 prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
 .
 If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
 transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
 transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
 how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
 this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this
 requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
 ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
 work has been installed in ROM).
 .
 The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
 work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
 Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
 denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
 operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
 across the network.
 .
 Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
 with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
 implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require
 no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
 7. Additional Terms.
 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
 making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions
 that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
 included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
 law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may
 be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
 governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
 When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
 additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
 permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
 you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
 by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
 permission.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
 covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
 supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
 sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
 attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
 works containing it; or
 .
 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
 that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
 different from the original version; or
 .
 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
 the material; or
 .
 e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
 trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
 anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
 assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
 contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
 .
 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
 within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
 part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along
 with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
 license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
 conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
 by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
 does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
 in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
 those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
 .
 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
 separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
 apply either way.
 .
 8. Termination.
 .
 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
 under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
 and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
 patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
 .
 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
 particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
 the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
 permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
 some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
 reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
 of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
 violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
 .
 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
 of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
 your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
 qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
 .
 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
 of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
 consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
 not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
 permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
 copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
 propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
 so.
 .
 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
 license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
 subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
 third parties with this License.
 .
 An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
 results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
 a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&apos;s
 predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
 right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
 predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
 reasonable efforts.
 .
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
 granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
 license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
 License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
 counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
 making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
 portion of it.
 .
 11. Patents.
 .
 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
 the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
 called the contributor&apos;s "contributor version".
 .
 A contributor&apos;s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
 controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
 that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
 using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
 be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
 version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
 License.
 .
 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
 license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to make, use,
 sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
 contents of its contributor version.
 .
 In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement
 or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
 permission to practice a patent or covenant not to s ue for patent
 infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such
 an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
 .
 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
 Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
 charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
 network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
 cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
 yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
 arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
 extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual
 knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in
 a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work in a country, would
 infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
 to believe are valid.
 .
 If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
 convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
 patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
 them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
 then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
 of the covered work and works based on it.
 .
 A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of
 its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
 of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.
 You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a
 third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you
 make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
 conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
 license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
 copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
 specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
 entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
 March 2007.
 .
 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
 license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to
 you under applicable patent law.
 .
 12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.
 .
 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
 you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so
 as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
 pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
 collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
 Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
 be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program,
 your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it
 remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction)
 an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing
 access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through
 some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This
 Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work
 covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated
 pursuant to the following paragraph.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
 link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
 GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
 resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
 which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
 governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
 14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
 Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
 similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
 new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
 that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or
 any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
 and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
 published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
 version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any
 version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
 GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s public
 statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
 version for the Program.
 .
 Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
 However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
 holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
 .
 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
 PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
 QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
 DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 CORRECTION.
 .
 16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
 COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
 PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
 THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
 PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
 be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
 apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
 liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
 liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
 them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
 of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
 pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
 along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,
 you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.
 For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display
 a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways
 you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
 programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
 any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
 information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <http://
 www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
 the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
 modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
 this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
 credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
 such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
 addressed as "you".
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&apos;s overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
 subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
 not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
 PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
 by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
 purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&apos;s title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
 conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
 and the Document&apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
 the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
 Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
 general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
 charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
 option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
 distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
 until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
 copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
 the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
 them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
 from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
 Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
 Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
 Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
 adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
 terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document&apos;s license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
 it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
 publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
 there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
 stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
 given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
 Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
 public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
 the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
 it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
 least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
 publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
 preserve the section&apos;s title, and preserve in the section all the
 substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
 and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
 unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
 may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
 or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&apos;s license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
 entitled "Endorsements."
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
 other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
 of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
 compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
 License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
 with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
 are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
 of the entire aggregate, the Document&apos;s Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
 Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
 translation of this License provided that you also include the
 original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
 between the translation and the original English version of this
 License, the original English version will prevail.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
 copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
 of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 .
 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
 the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:
 .
 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
 under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
 with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
 Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
 Free Documentation License".
 .
 If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
 instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no
 Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
 "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
 .
 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
 recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
 free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
 to permit their use in free software.

 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
 assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
 with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
 for modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
 distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
 world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
 work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,
 refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
 licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you
 copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
 under copyright law.
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&apos;s overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
 section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
 allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
 Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
 Sections then there are none.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
 be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, that is suitable for revising the document
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
 or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
 An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
 of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
 transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
 include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
 proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
 processors for output purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&apos;s title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
 title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
 text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
 specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
 of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
 section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
 .
 The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
 states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
 Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
 License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
 implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
 no effect on the meaning of this License.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
 conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
 printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
 Document&apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a computer-network location from which the general network-using
 public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
 a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
 when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
 that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
 location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
 Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
 edition to the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
 them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
 from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
 Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
 Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
 unless they release you from this requirement.
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
 Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
 adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
 terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document&apos;s license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
 to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
 publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
 there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
 stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
 given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
 Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
 public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
 the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
 it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
 least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
 publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
 Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
 the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
 and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
 unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
 may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
 or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&apos;s license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
 Entitled "Endorsements".
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
 other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
 resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
 of the compilation&apos;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
 When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
 apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
 derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
 the entire aggregate, the Document&apos;s Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
 electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
 aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
 translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
 Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
 the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
 or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 .
 If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
 its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
 title.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
 copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
 of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 .
 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
 the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:
 .
 Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document

 .
 If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
 replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
 .

 .
 If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
 combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
 situation.
 .
 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
 recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
 free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
 to permit their use in free software.

 .
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
 assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
 with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
 for modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
 distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
 world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
 work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,
 refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
 licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you
 copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
 under copyright law.
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&apos;s overall
 subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
 directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
 part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
 any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
 section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
 allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
 Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
 Sections then there are none.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
 be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, that is suitable for revising the document
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
 or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
 An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
 of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
 transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
 include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
 proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
 processors for output purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&apos;s title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
 the Document to the public.
 .
 A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
 title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
 text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
 specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
 of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
 section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
 .
 The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
 states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
 Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
 License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
 implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
 no effect on the meaning of this License.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
 other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
 printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
 Document&apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a computer-network location from which the general network-using
 public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
 a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
 when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
 that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
 location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
 Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
 edition to the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
 give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
 Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
 from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
 Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
 Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
 unless they release you from this requirement.
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
 Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
 adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
 terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document&apos;s license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
 to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
 publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
 there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
 stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
 given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
 Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
 public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
 the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
 it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
 least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
 publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
 Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
 the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
 and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
 unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
 may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
 or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&apos;s license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
 Entitled "Endorsements".
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
 documents released under this License, and replace the individual
 copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
 that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
 of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
 other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
 distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
 copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
 License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
 document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
 resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
 of the compilation&apos;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
 When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
 apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
 derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
 the entire aggregate, the Document&apos;s Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
 electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
 aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
 translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
 Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
 the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
 or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 .
 If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
 "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
 its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
 title.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
 will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 .
 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
 terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
 fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
 60 days after the cessation.
 .
 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
 not give you any rights to use it.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
 GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
 detail to address new problems or concerns. See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
 specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
 License can be used, that proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of a
 version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
 Document.

 11. RELICENSING
 .
 "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
 World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
 provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
 public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
 "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
 means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
 .
 "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
 corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
 California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
 published by that same organization.
 .
 "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
 part, as part of another Document.
 .
 An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
 License, and if all works that were first published under this License
 somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
 in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
 (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
 .
 The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
 under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
 provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
 .
 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

 .
 Preamble
 .
 The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
 at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The
 General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation&apos;s
 software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
 You can use it for your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
 sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
 software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
 programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must tell them their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors&apos; reputations.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
 distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
 "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
 on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
 Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each
 licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
 General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
 other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
 along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of
 transferring a copy.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
 it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
 .
 a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 you changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
 b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
 in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
 with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
 third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
 that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
 third parties, at your option).
 .
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
 run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
 in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
 that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
 warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
 conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
 Public License.
 .
 d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
 copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
 exchange for a fee.
 .
 Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
 derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
 the other work under the scope of these terms.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
 it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
 b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
 for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
 corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
 c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
 corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
 .
 Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
 exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
 libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
 file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
 accompany that operating system.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
 Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
 the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
 the Program under this License. However, parties who have received
 copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
 on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
 and all its terms and conditions.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
 licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
 terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
 recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.
 .
 7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
 the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
 8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
 terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
 attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
 the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
 any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&apos;.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the
 appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
 commands you use may be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show
 c&apos;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
 program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
 and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
 guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
 software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
 of the Free Software Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose
 authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
 covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
 General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
 distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
 that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
 the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
 can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
 you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
 translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
 software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
 a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
 sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
 these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and
 /or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that
 everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
 software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
 know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
 by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos; reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
 to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
 obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
 this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;
 s free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
 placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
 or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
 derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
 Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
 translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
 limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
 this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
 restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
 constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
 running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
 Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
 at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
 forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
 or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
 these conditions:
 .
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 you changed the files and the date of any change.
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
 part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
 licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
 License.
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
 must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
 ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
 copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
 you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
 conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
 such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
 an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
 sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
 considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
 its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
 works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
 work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
 of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
 whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
 the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
 Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
 License.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
 which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange; or,
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
 any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
 source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
 source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
 corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
 distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
 form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
 source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
 definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
 of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
 need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
 binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
 accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
 code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
 third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
 expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
 sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
 your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
 rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
 long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
 or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
 accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
 any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
 do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
 copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of
 the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
 third parties to this License.
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
 are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
 contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
 conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
 simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
 obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
 of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
 you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
 the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
 other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
 section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
 distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
 people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
 distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
 choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
 countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
 geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
 distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
 case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
 this License.
 .
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
 spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
 or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
 a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
 you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
 the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
 any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
 whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
 permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
 write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
 all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
 software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
 THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
 STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
 PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
 PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
 ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
 ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
 PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
 INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
 BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
 OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
 them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
 of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
 pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 one line to give the program&apos;s name and an idea of what it does.

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
 starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
 type `show w&apos;. This is free software, and you are welcome
 to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c&apos;

 The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the
 appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you
 use may be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they
 could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
 a sample; alter the names:

Copyright: 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License:   GPL-3.0+:FULL_LICENSE
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
 other kinds of works.
 .
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
 away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
 Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
 versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
 We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
 of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
 authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
 General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
 distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
 receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
 software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
 or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
 responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
 responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
 a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
 must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
 copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 .
 For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&apos; and
 authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors
 of previous versions.
 .
 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
 versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
 is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&apos; freedom to
 change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
 products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
 unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
 the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
 domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
 versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 .
 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
 should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
 general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
 danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
 proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
 render the program non-free.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 0. Definitions.
 .
 “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
 “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
 such as semiconductor masks.
 .
 “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
 Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be
 individuals or organizations.
 .
 To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
 fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
 The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work
 “based on” the earlier work.
 .
 A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
 Program.
 .
 To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
 would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
 copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
 Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
 making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
 To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
 make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
 network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
 An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the
 extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
 displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
 no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
 that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
 of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
 such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
 1. Source Code.
 The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.
 .
 A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard
 defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
 for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
 working in that language.
 .
 The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the
 work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
 Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
 to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
 Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
 form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
 which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
 object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
 The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source
 code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
 code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work&apos;s System Libraries, or
 general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
 unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
 For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
 associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
 libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
 designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
 between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
 automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
 .
 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
 .
 2. Basic Permissions.
 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
 the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
 License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
 Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
 if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
 acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
 copyright law.
 .
 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
 conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
 covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
 exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
 provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
 material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
 the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
 direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
 conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
 unnecessary.
 .
 3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
 under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
 copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
 restricting circumvention of such measures.
 .
 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
 effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
 work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
 work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s users, your or third
 parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
 .
 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you receive
 it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
 each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
 this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
 to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
 all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
 offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
 from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
 provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
 giving a relevant date.
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
 License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
 requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
 who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
 with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
 all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
 permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
 such permission if you have separately received it.
 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
 Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
 display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
 .
 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
 which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
 combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
 storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and
 its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
 compilation&apos;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of
 a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
 other parts of the aggregate.
 .
 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
 under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
 .
 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on
 a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
 least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
 support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
 either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
 product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
 customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
 reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
 access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer
 to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
 occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
 such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or
 for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the
 same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require
 recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the
 place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may
 be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
 equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
 the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of
 what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that
 it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform
 other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are
 being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
 .
 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
 Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
 object code work.
 .
 A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible
 personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
 purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
 In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
 resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
 particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that
 class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
 in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
 the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product
 has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
 represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
 “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
 authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
 modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
 version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
 that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
 prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
 .
 If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
 transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
 transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
 how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
 this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this
 requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
 ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
 work has been installed in ROM).
 .
 The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
 work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
 Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
 denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
 operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
 across the network.
 .
 Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
 with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
 implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require
 no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
 7. Additional Terms.
 “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
 making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions
 that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
 included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
 law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may
 be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
 governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
 When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
 additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
 permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
 you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
 by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
 permission.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
 covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
 supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
 sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
 attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
 works containing it; or
 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
 that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
 different from the original version; or
 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
 the material; or
 e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
 trademarks, or service marks; or
 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
 anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
 assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
 contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
 .
 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions”
 within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
 part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along
 with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
 license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
 conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
 by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
 does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
 in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
 those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
 .
 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
 separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
 apply either way.
 .
 8. Termination.
 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
 under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
 and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
 patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
 .
 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
 particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
 the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
 permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
 some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
 reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
 of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
 violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
 .
 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
 of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
 your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
 qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
 .
 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
 of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
 consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
 not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
 permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
 copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
 propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
 so.
 .
 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
 license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
 subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
 third parties with this License.
 .
 An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
 results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
 a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party&apos;s
 predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
 right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
 predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
 reasonable efforts.
 .
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
 granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
 license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
 License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
 counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
 making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
 portion of it.
 .
 11. Patents.
 A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
 the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
 called the contributor&apos;s “contributor version”.
 .
 A contributor&apos;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or
 controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
 that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
 using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
 be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
 version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
 License.
 .
 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
 license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to make, use,
 sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
 contents of its contributor version.
 .
 In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement
 or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
 permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
 infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such
 an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
 .
 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
 Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
 charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
 network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
 cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
 yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
 arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
 extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means
 you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work in
 a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
 you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
 If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
 convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
 patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
 them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
 then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
 of the covered work and works based on it.
 .
 A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of
 its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
 of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.
 You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a
 third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you
 make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
 conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
 license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
 copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
 specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
 entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
 March 2007.
 .
 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
 license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to
 you under applicable patent law.
 .
 12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.
 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
 you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so
 as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
 pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
 example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
 further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you
 could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
 from conveying the Program.
 .
 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
 link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
 GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
 the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
 part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
 General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network
 will apply to the combination as such.
 .
 14. Revised Versions of this License.
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
 General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
 spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
 or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
 that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later
 version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
 of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
 GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s public statement of
 acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
 the Program.
 .
 Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
 However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
 holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
 .
 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
 PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
 QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
 DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 CORRECTION.
 .
 16. Limitation of Liability.
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
 COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
 PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
 THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
 PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
 be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
 apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
 liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
 liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
 them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
 of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a
 pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
 this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
 This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&apos;.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the
 appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&apos;s
 commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
 any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more
 information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://
 www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
 it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
 this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
 of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/
 why-not-lgpl.html>.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
 and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
 guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
 software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
 designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
 authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
 General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
 distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
 that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
 the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
 can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
 you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
 translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
 library, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
 fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
 make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a
 program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
 recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes
 to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.
 .
 Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
 and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 Also, for each distributor&apos;s protection, we want to make certain that
 everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the
 library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
 know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems
 introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos;
 reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
 to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually
 obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into
 proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
 must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
 General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
 the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated
 libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to
 read it in full, and don&apos;t assume that anything in it is the same as in
 the ordinary license.
 .
 The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
 blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
 and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the
 library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running
 a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal
 sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original
 library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
 .
 Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
 for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
 developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might
 promote sharing better.
 .
 However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
 those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.
 This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of
 non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a
 user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in
 them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files,
 but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the
 Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free
 libraries.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
 library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
 from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.
 .
 Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
 Public License rather than by this special one.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
 be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also
 called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
 to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
 functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
 been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
 the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
 containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
 modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
 "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
 code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
 files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
 library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
 this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
 the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
 if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
 of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
 the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s complete
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
 and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
 with the Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
 at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
 forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
 or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
 these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
 you changed the files and the date of any change.
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
 third parties under the terms of this License.
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
 data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
 than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
 good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
 such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
 of its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
 that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
 Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
 this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
 square root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
 sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
 considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
 its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
 works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
 work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
 of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
 whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
 the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
 Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
 License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
 instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
 alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
 ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
 a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
 appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
 any other change in these notices.
 .
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
 the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
 derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
 into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
 the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
 though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
 code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
 designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
 called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
 derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
 License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
 executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
 the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
 therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
 such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
 part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
 the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
 especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
 work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
 defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
 and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
 in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
 whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
 code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
 object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
 containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
 directly with the Library itself.
 .
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work
 that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
 of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
 that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use
 and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
 used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
 must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
 copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
 them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
 Also, you must do one of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
 code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
 must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
 executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
 that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
 modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
 the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
 of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
 the application to use the modified definitions.)
 b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
 charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
 c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
 from the same place.
 d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that
 you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
 include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
 from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
 include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
 with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
 on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
 executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
 other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
 system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
 together in an executable that you distribute.
 .
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
 side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
 covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
 the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
 library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
 things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
 Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed
 under the terms of the Sections above.
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it
 is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
 uncombined form of the same work.
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
 modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
 have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
 their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
 or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
 accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
 any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
 do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
 copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
 conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;
 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
 compliance by third parties to this License.
 .
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
 are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
 contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
 conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
 simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
 obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
 of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
 you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
 the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
 other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
 section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
 distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
 people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
 distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
 choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
 countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
 geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
 distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
 case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
 this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
 similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
 new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
 a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
 you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
 the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
 version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
 whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
 to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
 for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
 status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
 reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
 THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
 STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
 LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
 PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
 ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
 ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
 LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
 INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
 BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
 OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
 redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
 terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
 License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
 exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
 and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 one line to give the library&apos;s name and an idea of what it does.

 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
 successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
 number 2.1.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
 and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
 guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
 software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
 designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
 Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
 suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
 General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
 based on the explanations below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
 to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
 wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
 change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
 informed that you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
 to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
 restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
 copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
 fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
 make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
 code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
 recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
 to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
 and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
 warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
 and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
 original version, so that the original author&apos;s reputation will not be
 affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
 .
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
 program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
 users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
 holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
 the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
 license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
 General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
 applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
 ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
 order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
 library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
 derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
 therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
 of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
 linking other code with the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
 to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It
 also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
 competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the
 ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license
 provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
 widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
 standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
 library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
 widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
 limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
 Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
 enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
 example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
 more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
 GNU/Linux operating system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users&
 apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with
 the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
 modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
 library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
 from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
 to run.
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
 which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
 Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
 "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
 to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
 functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
 been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
 the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
 containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
 modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
 "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
 code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
 files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
 library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
 this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
 the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
 if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
 of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
 the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s complete
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
 and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
 and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
 with the Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
 at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
 forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
 or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
 these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
 you changed the files and the date of any change.
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
 third parties under the terms of this License.
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
 data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
 than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
 good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
 such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
 of its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
 that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
 Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
 this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
 square root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
 sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
 considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
 its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
 works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
 work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
 of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
 whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
 the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
 Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
 License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
 instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
 alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
 ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
 a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
 appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
 any other change in these notices.
 .
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
 the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
 derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
 into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
 the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
 though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
 code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
 designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
 called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
 derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
 License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
 executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
 the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
 therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
 such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
 part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
 the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
 especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
 work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
 defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
 and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
 in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
 whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
 code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
 object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
 containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
 directly with the Library itself.
 .
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
 that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
 of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
 that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use
 and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
 used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
 must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
 copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
 them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
 Also, you must do one of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
 code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
 must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
 executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
 that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
 modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
 the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
 of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
 the application to use the modified definitions.)
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
 suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
 already present on the user&apos;s computer system, rather than copying library
 functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
 version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
 version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
 charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
 from the same place.
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that
 you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
 include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
 from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
 not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
 system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
 other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
 system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
 together in an executable that you distribute.
 .
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
 side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
 covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
 the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
 library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
 things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
 Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed
 under the terms of the Sections above.
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it
 is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
 uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
 modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
 have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
 their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
 or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
 accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
 any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
 do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
 copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
 conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;
 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
 compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
 are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
 contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
 conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
 simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
 obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
 of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
 you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
 the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
 other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
 section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
 distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
 people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
 distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
 choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
 countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
 geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
 distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
 case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
 this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
 similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
 new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
 a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
 you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
 the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
 version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
 whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
 to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
 for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
 status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
 reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
 THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
 STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
 LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
 PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
 ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
 ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
 LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
 INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
 BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
 OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
 redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
 terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
 License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
 exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
 and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 one line to give the library&apos;s name and an idea of what it does.
