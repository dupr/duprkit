# serial 5 lt~obsolete.m4

# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
#
# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
#
# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
#
# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
#
# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.

# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.
