Description: Debian User Recipe Toolkit
 DUR Toolkit (durkit) is a set of tools designed for creating and utilizing
 user packaging recipe, which aims to simplify the source tree debianization
 process.  A recipe defines how to get the source package and how to debianize
 the source tree, and can be transformed into a debianized source tree, .dsc
 files, or .deb files directly, at user's option.  A set of recipe files form
 a Collection, namely a Debian User Repository.
