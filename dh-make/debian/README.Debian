README for dh_make
==================

License for generated files
---------------------------
Please read /usr/share/doc/dh-make/copyright. Since 0.37 of dh-make the output
files of the program are able to be used without restriction. The question is
then, which license to use?  The templates will default to GPL v3 but you are
free to change it. The most likely best second option is to make the license
of the generated and customised (by you) files the same as the main program's
license.
